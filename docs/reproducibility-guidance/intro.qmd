## What is reproducibility?

For robust scientific progress, new methods or approaches should be confirmed independently before they are widely adopted. The goal of appropriately structuring and sharing research objects in a transparent fashion is to simplify this peer review process.[^1] The primary way this is achieved by creating and publicly publishing a [**research compendium**](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/compendia) along with the paper. A **research compendium** is a collection of digital parts of the research project that supports reuse, including data, code, protocols, documentation, metadata, etc.[^2]

[^1]: A good overview of [reproducible research is done by the Turing Way](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/overview). The book also covers [open research](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/open) and many other topics.

[^2]: See [Research Compendia in The Turing Way](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/compendia) for more detail on this concept.

## Why does it help?

The main principle of the [**research compendium**](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/compendia) is to provide all the information about the project publicly and structured in a clear and logical way to ensure that its use is straightforward. This helps researchers themselves as they can easily jump back to a previous project, simplify the task for reviewers or those who want to extend the research, as well as those simply looking to learn. If done properly, the research compendium will help:[^3]

[^3]: See a more in depth overview of the [benefits of reproducible research](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/overview/overview-benefit), as well as [common barriers](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/overview/overview-barriers).

-   Improve the transparency, reliability and reproducibility of research.
-   Simplify peer review.
-   Facilitate data and code sharing.
-   Allow easy extension of the research.
-   Enable learners to understand the research.
-   Make it much easier to transition a new method to production.[^4]
-   Increase research visibility and citations.

[^4]: Research compendia are conceptually quite similar to **Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAPs)**, although the latter focuses more on production processes. Hence if the research is easy to reproduce by adopting a compendium structure and making everything easily reproducible, operationalizing of a new method could be dramatically simplified. For more on RAPs in price statistics, see a [RAP class recently done by ESCAP](https://escap-sd.github.io/ESCAP_RAP_class/docs/), as well as a good paper by [Price and Marques (2023)](https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2023-05/7.4%20UK_un_systems_railfares_paper.pdf) showcasing RAP for production processes.

## Key components in a research project

To make a research project reproducible, it is key to to observe that there is not one object that is produced (i.e. the paper), but 4. @fig-research-objects provides a visual that can help understand what each is intended to for and how to approach each for reproducibility.

### (1) The data

The input data is one of the first and most critical aspects of empirical research. Whatever research questions are asked, they need to be evaluated using one or several datasets.

-   Ideally, input datasets are openly available, as this ensures that the dataset can be used as a benchmark for many different researches over time and help ensure that true reproduciblity is possible. To help increase the use of open datasets, this project includes a catalogue that lists key datasets in the discipline and documents each to help understand it with minimal effort.

-   The input data is owned (and hosted) separately from the research, hence it is not republished with the research project. Ideally the research project automates the collection and processing of the data

It is key to differentiate input data and output data:

-   Input data is the data used to answer research questions. It may be open, closed (proprietary or sensitive), or synthetic. Each is approached separately.

-   Ouput data is data created as part of the research process. Whether (and how) its shared depends on various circumstances and value to later research projects (to say act as an input dataset for other projects).

### (2) The research compendium

The research compendium is a **structured object** that contains **all the aspects** to recreate the output (i.e. results shared in the paper). Some key sub-components include:

-   Its logical **structure** ensures maturity and helps others (or you later) in trying to peer review, reproduce or extend the research.

-   The code and workflows **ingest and processes** input data to **create relevant outputs** (output data, figures, etc) in an automated fashion (i.e. avoiding manual steps). As mentioned above, the **input data** itself however **is not** a part of the compendium and is not republished.

-   The source for the paper is included so that raw input to final paper can be reproduced in an automated fashion. This allows you to regenerate and change the paper as needed.

It is key to differentiate between active and archived versions of the compendium:

#### 2A. Active research compendium

When a project is active, it is best to use a version control process (such as GitHub/GitLab) to store the whole object. While GitHub/GitLab are great for technical maturity and robustness, they are not permanent records - i.e. the GitHub repository can be deleted or changed, making it hard to find later.

#### 2B. Archived research compendium

When a research project is complete, the compendium should thus be archived in a repository. The snapshot created at this time should align to the paper that was published. Repositories (such as Zenodo) mint DOIs (or Digitial Object Identifiers) that are unique and are immutable (i.e. don't change). This ensures that you can find that same snapshot at any point in the future.

## Adoption depends on the organization

Use of repositories such as Zenodo depends on the researchers and the organization they are in.

### (3) Key software 

Not all code in the research compendium will be written by the researchers from scratch using vanilla code. It is likely to use packages to abstract away some or most of the complexity and automate the work. There are two sensible rules of thumb that can be applied:

-   If the code is pivotal to the methodology (for instance the package was used to calculate price indices), then it is best to acknowledge this in the paper (by citing it).

-   A snapshot of the computational environment should be taken and included in the research compendium. This ensures that the exact computation requirement can be replicated, but also to ensure that dependencies on specific versions of other packages is saved.

### (4) The paper

Finally, the paper is generated as the output. As the research compendium should (ideally) have the source to generate the paper (such as by using Quarto to render a `paper.qmd` as a pdf), outputs or images in the paper can be traced back from the body of the image to the code that generated them.

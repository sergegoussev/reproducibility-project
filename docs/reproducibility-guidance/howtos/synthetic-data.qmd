## WIP

This page is still in the works. Possible topics (see [#43](https://github.com/UN-Task-Team-for-Scanner-Data/reproducibility-project/issues/43) for more info) to include:

-   Common packages for making synthetic data. You could include these in research compendium and others could recreate your data.

-   To publish synthetic data or not (to say Zenodo)

-   Modifying real data so that it can be shared.

## Section in progress

Licences are a complex topic. We cannot offer much more than what others have already written -- so while we work on a succinct and accurate summary that applies most to the discipline, we recommend a few of the following that cover the topic quite well:

-   The quite comprehensive [Turing Way chapter on Licences](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/licensing/)

-   [How to FAIR's guide on Data Licenses](https://www.howtofair.dk/how-to-fair/data-licences/) is robust and succinct

## WIP

This page is still in the works. It will refer to guidance, including:

-   Licenses for code (such as by [NHS RAP guide](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/implementing_RAP/publishing_code/licensing-your-code/#what-is-a-software-licence))

-   Data licenses (such as [by How to FAIR](https://www.howtofair.dk/how-to-fair/data-licences/))

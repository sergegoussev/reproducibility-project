## WIP

This page is still in the works. Possile topics (see [#52](https://github.com/UN-Task-Team-for-Scanner-Data/reproducibility-project/issues/52) for more info) could include:

-   Licenses for code (such as by [NHS RAP guide](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/implementing_RAP/publishing_code/licensing-your-code/#what-is-a-software-licence))

-   Data licenses (such as [by How to FAIR](https://www.howtofair.dk/how-to-fair/data-licences/))

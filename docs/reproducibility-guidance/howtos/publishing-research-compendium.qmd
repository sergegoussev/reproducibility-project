## WIP

This page is still in the works. Scope to include:

-   For active projects, publishing to GitHub is sufficient - you can cite a paper in GitHub if you want (and the paper can be archived).

-   Ideally (given the processes researchers need to follow with their research institutes), a 'snapshot' of the research compendium to a repository that mints a DOI will ensure that the compendium **in the state matching the paper** has a persistent ID. 

-   Publishing data to a repository that mints a DOI is also a way to make the object persist and give it a unique ID.

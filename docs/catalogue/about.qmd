Researchers often struggle to use open data. They may find it hard to find open datasets for their research projects. If they find open datasets, they may struggle to easily understand them in order to confirm which works best for their research. Finally they may find it challenging to know how to work with or even how to cite the dataset.

The Price Statistics Open Data Catlogue helps find, assess, and understand how to access open datasets.

## How the Price Statistics Open Data Catalogue works in a nutshell

The idea is simple. The catalogue lists open datasets relevant to the discipline and is searchable according to standard tags (more on tags below). It also provides basic information about each dataset that allows researchers to assess its relevance and know how to access it. Visually this is shown in @fig-catalogue.

## What are the tags used in the catalogue?

The catalogue uses the following tag structure to categorize the datasets:

### Data type

The first set of tags categorize the dataset whether it fits our norm

-   `scanner`
-   `web-scraped`
-   `administrative`
-   `field-or-sample`

### Associated Tasks

This set of tags add information for known possible uses of the data

-   `bilaterals`
-   `multilaterals`
-   `classification`
-   `seasonal`
-   `quality-adjustment`

## Where is the data catalogue?

The [data catalogue can be found here](https://un-task-team-for-scanner-data.github.io/price-stats-data-catalogue/). It is basically a simple static site hosted on GitHub.

## What does the catalogue not do?

As the catalogue does not store the dataset itself but simply describes it in detail. In other words, this catalogue is [not a data repository](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-repository#rr-rdm-repository-select).

## This is an interim catalogue only!

This will likely not be the long-term stable data catalogue used in the discipline. The idea, however, it to start with this interim (and very simple open-source) catalogue, while the project investigates a more viable longer term solution.

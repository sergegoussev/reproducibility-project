Researchers often struggle to use open data. They may find it hard to find open datasets for their research projects. If they find open datasets, they may struggle to easily understand them in order to judge that the datasets easily work for their research. Finally they may find it challenging to know how to work with or even how to cite the dataset.

To help find, assess, and understand how to access open datasets, this project has developed a basic discipline specific catalogue.

## How the Price Statistics Open Data Catalogue works in a nutshell

The idea is simple. The catalogue lists open datasets relevant to the discipline and is searchable according to standard data types (such as scanner data). It also provides basic information about each dataset that will allow researchers to assess its relevance and know how to access it. Visually this is shown in @fig-catalogue.

## Where is the data catalogue?

The [data catalogue can be found here](https://un-task-team-for-scanner-data.github.io/price-stats-data-catalogue/). It is basically a simple static site hosted on GitHub.

## How to register an open dataset on the catalogue?

The [CONTRIBUTING guidance in the catalogue](https://github.com/UN-Task-Team-for-Scanner-Data/price-stats-data-catalogue/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) summarizes it all. Have a look and help register a dataset or recommend one be registered!

## What does the catalogue not do?

As the catalogue does not store the dataset itself but simply describes it in detail. In other words, this catalogue is [not a data repository](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-repository#rr-rdm-repository-select).

## This is an interim catalogue only!

This will very likely not be the long-term stable data catalogue used in the discpline. The idea, however, it to start with this interim (and very simple open-source) catalogue, while the project investigates a more viable longer term solution.

# Project Charter

## Project overview

Research in the price statistics discipline is not as reproducible as we feel it should be. Most researchers utilize proprietary datasets (for instance internal datasets owned by their NSOs as part of their official work, or purchased datasets that require considerable financial investment for others to acquire). Research is also usually done with proprietary software and is not shared with the research output. The result is that it is challenging to reproduce or replicate trialed methods, as well as to extend and teach (oneself or others) the methods in question.

This consequence is far from the intention of researchers, but is a result of the challenges within the discipline making adoption of good practices hard. For instance, it is not easy to find, access, or understand open datasets so that they can be used for research purposes. There is also a lack of discipline-specific guidance on how Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, or Reusable (or FAIR) principles can be applied to projects to make them reproducible.

## *Raison d'être* of the project

The project aims to instill reproducibility within the discipline by lowering barriers and simplifying processes for adoption of good practices. This overarching goal is aligned with the [Principles of Official Statistics](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/dnss/hb/E-fundamental%20principles_A4-WEB.pdf), specifically the strengthening of professional standards, scientific principles, and professional ethics.

# Objectives of the project

## Overall objective

**Objective**: Instill reproducibility principles in methodological and pedagogical material shared within the discipline (in alignment with the FAIR principles)

This overall objective can be broken down into 4 key results that can themselves be sub-objectives.

## Guidance sub-objective

Develop guidance on reproducibility to outline the why, the what, the where, the when (in the research process) and the how to apply best practices to make the discipline open and FAIR

## Data Catalogue sub-objective

Catalogue all applicable datasets that researchers could leverage for research purposes, whether they are open or proprietary but highly applicable.

## Training sub-objective

Deliver training on challenging aspects of reproducibility to support the guidance sub-objective

## Reproducibility promotion sub-objective

Instill reproducibility by showcasing it within the community and integrate it within administrative processes of the discipline to drive adoption.

# Project management structure

The project adopts [the OKR framework](https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/okr-meaning-definition-example) to structure key results that help deliver each objective. To pace the project, an annual cycle is used to fit into a several year horizon and report back to the discipline at our annual conferences (the Ottawa Group and the Group of Experts on the CPI). As such:

-   Each year a GitHub milestone is structured to track the Key Results for the year
-   GitHub issues are used as Key Results to track specific major deliverables helping make progress towards the relevant objectives.
-   Labels are used to categorize the various Key Results around the FAIR principles.

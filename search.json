    "text": "Overall\nWhile researchers can reference and describe the data and code they use throughout their code in any number of ways that best fits the layout of the research paper, we also recommend a simple process for citation depending on if there is a DOI for the data and code.\n\nReference the research compendium and data made available in a structured way\nFirst off, we recommend the structure used in Nature by the FAIR team in their Baker et al (2022) paper. Specifically, at the end of the paper just before the bibiliography, two sections are added on the data and the code made available with the research paper. Adopting this structured approach makes it easy to quickly show readers how to find the various objects that are published alongside the paper.\nA research compendium can be published to GitHub or on a data repository (in a way that aligns with the requirements of the institution the researcher works at) and cited in the “Code availability” section. Datasets made available by the research project can also be published on a data repository (also based on requirements of the institution the researcher is affiliated with) and referenced in the “Data availability” section. If the dataset may be useful for other research projects, the researcher can look to register the dataset on the price statistics data catalogue.\n\n\nReference datasets and code in the bibliography\nOthers’ code and datasets used as input to the research should be referenced in the bibliography/references section. Ideally both have a DOI so the object is easily findable and citable. The following two articles go into more details on how to cite and data as there are some nuances that may make it challenging."

    "text": "Citing an open dataset for a research project is straightforward if it is archived in an open research repository like Zenodo. In this case it will have the relevant metadata, along with a DOI, to make it easily citeable, even if access to these data is restricted. Unfortunately open datasets do not always reside in a repository like Zenodo. A common place for open datasets in statistics, and in particular price statistics, is as part of an R package on CRAN. Citing these datasets is not difficult—all CRAN packages have a DOI and are easily cited—but, as part of a package, data are more difficult to access."

We aim to:\n\nProvide clear and approachable guidance on how researchers in price statistics can make their projects reproducible (including by learning new skills, by understanding how to publish and cite code, and many other topics)\nSupport cataloging open datasets that can be used as benchmarks to use for research purposes. The idea is to have all findings trialed and demonstrated on open benchmark datasets.\n\nThe project also builds on great efforts of early promoters of open science in the discipline!1 We are aiming to continue to build momentum and make it easier for researchers to work openly!"

In either case, other researchers can reproduce the research, expand on it, and apply it to internal data.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Shifting from limited to fuller reproducibility (summarizing the main materials for a research, inspired by Bontemps and Orozco (2020))\n\n\nStepping back a bit, let us first define what reproducibility means. While there are many definitions, the aim of reproducible research is to ensure that work can be independently recreated from the same data and the same code. If researchers don’t have access to the same data (which may be locked down due to confidentiality reasons), researchers can aim to replicate the result with their own data.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Definitions of Reproducible Research by the Turing Way\n\n\nTo support open-science within price statistics, the project recommends:\n\nThat researchers in the discipline use of open datasets when available in order to support reproducible or robust research. This is why the project has started a catalogue of open datasets that can be leveraged for research purposes;\nThe publication of research code and related research artifacts so that other researchers can independently reproduce all research results. The project provides guidance on structuring and publishing research code so that others can reproduce your results.\n\nIdeally, both aspects are adopted by researchers. However even the adoption of one is valuable as it is possible to replicate the results with different data. Without either, a slower and less effective goal of science in the discipline is generalizable findings by non-reproducible research simply from what is stated in each researchers’ paper (the status quo)."

The group then decided how to tackle this problem and how to properly scope the objectives to make things achievable. Main challenges currently faced in the discipline included:\n\nReserach is becoming increasingly empirical, hence we need processes to work with data and code to make the research more easily reproducible\nThere are no agreed upon benchmark datasets per se in the discipline to test methods on\nThe discipline will not own most of the datasets as most research is done on either confidential internal datasets owned by NSOs or on proprietary (purchased datasets). The open datasets that exist are not organized or cohesively documented/available.\nThe reason why reproducibility is important is not as inherent/widely communicated as it could be, hence any attempts to solve the technical and processes aspects needs to include this aspect in the communication.\n\nThe group touched on goals to solve these aspects and on processes that can be set up to incentivize reproducibility, including by lowering the complexity and creating an easy ‘on ramp’ to making projects more reproducible (including by cataloging open datasets and showcasing how code can be made reproducible), coordinating with the two bi-annual confernece to recommend reproducibility be part of the paper submission process, embedding metadata standards into the data availbile to make it easier and more standardized when various benchmark datasets are used to evaluate a specific method, etc.\nThe data catalogue for open datasets was seen as a major deliverable to the discipline, and one that needed to be phased. In other words we can set up a ‘proof of concept’ or interim catalogue in a simple way to demonstrate the use case, and later transition to a fuller and more comprehensive catalogue with more resources and infrastructure, potentially hosted by the UN Global Platform. Showcasing the interim solution and broadening the adoption to beyond just price statistics would help make this business case.\nThe outcome of the discussion resolved to target two main deliverables: developing the proof of concept data catalogue, and writing guidance (for instance in the form of a white paper) on how to make projects more reproducible. This target scope was later summarized through our project charter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntro and discussion on timelines and scope.

It was decided to focus on an interim data catalogue and provide interim guidance at the conference, with the fuller guidance to be developed over the next year.\nGitHub projects was agreed upon as the structure for PM activity\nThe draft data catalogue idea was given the green light to flush out further as our likely implementation of the interim version. Metadata strandards should be implemented but it would be hard to use a platform where we don’t own the dataset (such as dominik’s data).\nGuidelines for how to develop reproducible research through git was seen as a good way, with the idea that the guidance we would produce would (a) provide the target state to aim for and (b) summarize maturity levels (similar to RAP maturity levels) that showcase how researchers can start easily and progress over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion on the proposed project charter for the project (since merged into main)\nUpdate on the 2 repositories for the project (project repo and interim data catalogue repo) and the mocked up project management approach\nRoundtable\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam discussed scope for 2025 CPI EG presentation. The project plan outlined two milestones, one on data catalogue and one on guidance will be the target. The project structure and use of the GitHub project was summarized.\nThe use of the two repos was discussed. The reproducibility-project repo will host the guidance we develop in whatever format we decide (ideas shared including using quarto to write reproducible papers, or a quarto static site if we will more tend towards creating guidance). price-stats-data-catalogue will host the interim open data catalogue.\nScope of the data contract was firmed up - we could aim to catalogue input datasets that are used to create some experimental indices and version the output datasets (that may be price indices or other artifacts) as part of the repository on github (such as by saving them in data folder and formatting them in tidy data format).\nUse of tools like Zenodo was discussed and will be investigated to mint DOIs - ticket #3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion on format for meeting minutes and how to review/approve the minutes each meeting.\nHow to track materials related to reproducibility but are just references to others’ material (not the overall guidance we will provide).\nWhat format is seen as the best way to deliver guidance on reproducibility? It is best to decide an applicable format and stick with it. Options include writing a paper, using a static site, or using the wiki\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team agreed on keeping notes in this meeting-minutes.md file. The team also agreed to the process:\n\nThe note taker would summarize the meeting and would draft a branch and prepare a Pull Request for the team to review the meeting minutes at the next meeting.\nAt the start of the next meeting, the team would review the PR, would commit any changes/fixes needed. and squash and commit the PR into the main branch to approve the minutes.\n\nThe team agreed to track other materials in other-open-materials.md for now\nThe team discussed the means of how guidance will be provided at the end of the day as a lot of material could be included based on the goals in Objective B of our project. Some possible options:\n\na paper (similar to say the FAIR paper on software to be presented at say 2026 Ottawa Group conference) as the main document for guidance and other materials as supporting (like the catalogue). This could use the quarto manuscript format for example.\na static site (again say a quarto one like this one) as the main means of sharing guidance, but also a short paper for the 2026 OG conference as an offline guide\na set of wiki pages similar to other content made by the Task Team\n\nThe team agreed that a static site (the quarto option) is likely the most appropriate as the site can be expanded and maintained as appropriate, a presentation with a link to the site could be provided at conferences.\nThe team discussed planning for the next 1.5 months. The project roadmap outlines the target timelines. As several issues remain unassigned, the team are encouraged to sign up based on bandwidth.\nRoundtable discussion included:\n\nUpdate on Zenodo - which is an option for uploading and citing data (detail in issue 3). There isn’t a process yet identified for datasets that are not owned by the community and where the owner does not upload it to a repository that mints a DOI.\nUpdate on citing data in PriceIndices R package as it has a DOI. Ability to extract the data without installing the package has to be confirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview mock up quarto site for the project, as well as contributing and code of conduct\nReview ongoing work prior to the 2025 CPI Expert Group\nRoundtable\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam discussed the mock up site structure with a home and two main sections, one on how to make your projects reproducible by publishing your code and on using open data.\nThe team also discussed the basic contributing guide and code of conduct.\nThe deliverables to be presented at the 2025 CPI Expert Group were discussed as per the view in the project roadmap.\nAn approach on how to import data from a package was discussed. For instance, how should researchers use data from an R package (such as the PriceIndices package, which has datasets we would like to make list in the interim catalogue) and they wanted to import the data and use it in Python? The team discussed on a phased approach: guidance on how to download the dataset and use it in python from the R ecosystem will be proposed; a longer term approach could be to work with dataset owners to get them to publish it on a repository like Zenodo.\nSupport by the UN Global Platform team for the project was also discussed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview of skeleton data catalogue\nReview of the changes to the project site, specifically how to cite code and how to cite data sections\nReview roadmap and discussion of topics left to finish in this phase of the project\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team discussed the skeleton of the proof of concecept data catalogue. The technical process to register new datasets is basically to (1) draft a new yaml file in the datasets/ folder using the datacontrac.cli specifications, and then (2) when the PR is accepted (after releveant review) and merged with the main branch, the runner will rerender the catalogue and the dataset will show up.\nThe team discussed next steps. The dataset in #6 is still the third we’d want for presentation at CPI EG.\nThere is a need to differentiate open versus proprietary but popular datasets. Open datasets will be the focus for now with potential for expansion after the conference.\nThe team discussed how to cite datasets and how to cite code topics, and based on the example by the recent Baker et al (2022) FAIR principles for software paper, we decided to go with a nuanced recomemndation for now:\n\nif data or code that a research uses exists should be included in the bibliography\ndata or code that is created as part of the paper should be (ideally published to something that mints a DOI) but the links to the dataset or code are included at the end of the paper under “Data availability” and “Code availability” headers.\nThe idea of topics to discuss after the confernece was also brought up - the process of creating synthetic datasets.\n\nTo support researchers to structure their code, the team also discussed and endoresed recommendign a template RAP."

It is best to decide an applicable format and stick with it. Options include writing a paper, using a static site, or using the wiki\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team agreed on keeping notes in this meeting-minutes.md file. The team also agreed to the process:\n\nThe note taker would summarize the meeting and would draft a branch and prepare a Pull Request for the team to review the meeting minutes at the next meeting.\nAt the start of the next meeting, the team would review the PR, would commit any changes/fixes needed. and squash and commit the PR into the main branch to approve the minutes.\n\nThe team agreed to track other materials in other-open-materials.md for now\nThe team discussed the means of how guidance will be provided at the end of the day as a lot of material could be included based on the goals in Objective B of our project. Some possible options:\n\na paper (similar to say the FAIR paper on software to be presented at say 2026 Ottawa Group conference) as the main document for guidance and other materials as supporting (like the catalogue). This could use the quarto manuscript format for example.\na static site (again say a quarto one like this one) as the main means of sharing guidance, but also a short paper for the 2026 OG conference as an offline guide\na set of wiki pages similar to other content made by the Task Team\n\nThe team agreed that a static site (the quarto option) is likely the most appropriate as the site can be expanded and maintained as appropriate, a presentation with a link to the site could be provided at conferences.\nThe team discussed planning for the next 1.5 months. The project roadmap outlines the target timelines. As several issues remain unassigned, the team are encouraged to sign up based on bandwidth.\nRoundtable discussion included:\n\nUpdate on Zenodo - which is an option for uploading and citing data (detail in issue 3). There isn’t a process yet identified for datasets that are not owned by the community and where the owner does not upload it to a repository that mints a DOI.\nUpdate on citing data in PriceIndices R package as it has a DOI. Ability to extract the data without installing the package has to be confirmed."

For instance, how should researchers use data from an R package (such as the PriceIndices package, which has datasets we would like to make list in the interim catalogue) and they wanted to import the data and use it in Python? The team discussed on a phased approach: guidance on how to download the dataset and use it in python from the R ecosystem will be proposed; a longer term approach could be to work with dataset owners to get them to publish it on a repository like Zenodo.\nSupport by the UN Global Platform team for the project was also discussed"

The technical process to register new datasets is basically to (1) draft a new yaml file in the datasets/ folder using the datacontrac.cli specifications, and then (2) when the PR is accepted (after releveant review) and merged with the main branch, the runner will rerender the catalogue and the dataset will show up.\nThe team discussed next steps. The dataset in #6 is still the third we’d want for presentation at CPI EG.\nThere is a need to differentiate open versus proprietary but popular datasets. Open datasets will be the focus for now with potential for expansion after the conference.\nThe team discussed how to cite datasets and how to cite code topics, and based on the example by the recent Baker et al (2022) FAIR principles for software paper, we decided to go with a nuanced recomemndation for now:\n\nif data or code that a research uses exists should be included in the bibliography\ndata or code that is created as part of the paper should be (ideally published to something that mints a DOI) but the links to the dataset or code are included at the end of the paper under “Data availability” and “Code availability” headers.\nThe idea of topics to discuss after the confernece was also brought up - the process of creating synthetic datasets.\n\nTo support researchers to structure their code, the team also discussed and endoresed recommendign a template RAP."

    "text": "There are two key challenges in the price statistics discipline when it comes to using open data. On the one hand, there are few open data available as most datasets of sufficient size and quality are proprietary. On the other hand, it is hard to find out what datasets do exist as there is not discipline specific listing. As most researchers are employed at organizations (such as National Statistical Organizations or NSOs) naturally have access to internal datasets and often are under pressure to answer questions relating them, it is only natural to default to proprietary over datasets. To help alleviate this, the project has developed a basic discipline specific data catalogue."

It is searchable according to standard data types (such as scanner data), and describes the metadata necessary for researchers to understand and select the dataset most applicable to them.\n\n\nWhat the catalogue does not do\nThe catalogue does not store the dataset itself but simply describes it in detail. The catalogue does provide a simple interface to common researcher questions, such as how to cite the dataset, limitations to its use, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an interim catalogue only!\n\n\n\nThis will very likely not be the long-term stable data catalogue the discpline.

    "text": "Citing software is historically not something that researchers have done. Code can often be hard to cite and the software used to derive the results of a paper was usually seen as a “detail” that is not worth mentioning in the body of paper. (Perhaps to avoid too many questions about how, exactly, the results in the paper were derived.) The last decade has seen a move towards more reproducible research in economics—mainstream journals require code and usually data for quantitative papers—and the proliferation of open-source research software has made it easier to reliably cite the software used for research.\nCiting code is particularly important in the area of price statistics to facilitate reproducible research. There are a great many price index methods, often with fiddly variations, used by different researchers and it is important to know the exact implementation used to generate a price index in order to reproduce the construction of that index. Research for price statistics is also usually done by government agencies; transparency about the code to generate the results that inform the methods used by government agencies is important to maintain the trust in official statistics.\nFor further reading, the Turing Way provides a good overview for citing code in research and represents the current state of the world of open-source research software."

Things are less standardized in the Python ecosystem, but the same ideas apply to make projects citeable (e.g., pandas).\nAnother way to cite a piece of research software is to the cite the paper introducing this software, usually in a journal like the Journal of Open Source Software, the Journal of Statistical Software, or the R Journal.\n@article{RJ-2021-038,\n  author = {Saavedra-Nieves, Alejandro and Saavedra-Nieves, Paula},\n  title = {IndexNumber: An R Package for Measuring the Evolution of Magnitudes},\n  journal = {The R Journal},\n  year = {2021},\n  note = {https://rjournal.github.io/},\n  volume = {13},\n  issue = {1},\n  issn = {2073-4859},\n  pages = {253-275}\n}\nFinally, for code that is not in a mainstream repository like CRAN, or does not have a website with citation information, citation information can sometimes be found in the source code.

The practice creating and publishing a research compendium may involve some technical skills, however it will help the research team leading the project, other researchers, and the discipline as a whole. It will also help publish official statistics with the methods being researched, as the Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) principles applied to reproducible and technically mature production processes leverage the very same technical best practices. Indeed, RAP and research compedia are conceptually the same things – the application of technical processes for reproducibility and process robustness – its just one focuses more on research and the other on production of official statistics."

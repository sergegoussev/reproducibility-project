    "text": "Citing software is historically not something that researchers have done. Code can often be hard to cite and the software used to derive the results of a paper was usually seen as a “detail” that is not worth mentioning in the body of paper. (Perhaps to avoid too many questions about how, exactly, the results in the paper were derived.) The last decade has seen a move towards more reproducible research in economics—mainstream journals require code and usually data for quantitative papers—and the proliferation of open-source research software has made it easier to reliably cite the software used for research.\nCiting code is particularly important in the area of price statistics to facilitate reproducible research. There are a great many price index methods, often with fiddly variations, used by different researchers and it is important to know the exact implementation used to generate a price index in order to reproduce the construction of that index. Research for price statistics is also usually done by government agencies; transparency about the code to generate the results that inform the methods used by government agencies is important to maintain the trust in official statistics.\nFor further reading, the Turing Way provides a good overview for citing code in research and represents the current state of the world of open-source research software."

    "text": "Citing research software\nUnlike academic papers, there is no one way to cite a piece of software. How to cite a piece of software usually depends on how easy the author makes it. For example, R packages are easy to cite within R using the citation() function.\n\ncitation(\"IndexNumR\")\n\nTo cite package 'IndexNumR' in publications use:\n\n  White G (2023). _IndexNumR: Index Number Calculation_. R package\n  version 0.6.0, &lt;https://github.com/grahamjwhite/IndexNumR&gt;.\n\nA BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is\n\n  @Manual{,\n    title = {IndexNumR: Index Number Calculation},\n    author = {Graham White},\n    year = {2023},\n    note = {R package version 0.6.0},\n    url = {https://github.com/grahamjwhite/IndexNumR},\n  }\n\nATTENTION: This citation information has been auto-generated from the\npackage DESCRIPTION file and may need manual editing, see\n'help(\"citation\")'.\n\n\nModern R packages tend to have their own website with this information on display and all CRAN packages get a DOI to facilitate referencing the use of R packages. Things are less standardized in the Python ecosystem, but the same ideas apply to make projects citeable (e.g., pandas).\nAnother way to cite a piece of research software is to the cite the paper introducing this software, usually in a journal like the Journal of Open Source Software, the Journal of Statistical Software, or the R Journal.\n@article{RJ-2021-038,\n  author = {Saavedra-Nieves, Alejandro and Saavedra-Nieves, Paula},\n  title = {IndexNumber: An R Package for Measuring the Evolution of Magnitudes},\n  journal = {The R Journal},\n  year = {2021},\n  note = {https://rjournal.github.io/},\n  volume = {13},\n  issue = {1},\n  issn = {2073-4859},\n  pages = {253-275}\n}\nFinally, for code that is not in a mainstream repository like CRAN, or does not have a website with citation information, citation information can sometimes be found in the source code. Github helps to find the citation information for a package and displays a button to cite the repository."

Although consumers of software tend not to get it directly from a source-code repository, citation metadata can be added to github repositories to make them more citeable."

    "text": "Research in the price statistics discipline is not as reproducible as we feel it should be. Most researchers utilize proprietary datasets (for instance internal datasets owned by their NSOs as part of their official work, or purchased datasets that require considerable financial investment for others to acquire). Research is also done using software available to researchers in a way that is custom to them and the code and detailed processes are typically not made easily available as part of the research project. This consequence is far from the intention of researchers, but is a result of the challenges to do this within the discipline. Specifically, it is not easy to find or access open datasets that can be used for research purposes. Once data is found, the metadata on each dataset will differ, making it challenging to process and use the data, such as for repeatable research processes. Finally, once a researcher has access to the data, it is not clear how code and processing logic should be shared as part of the research project to make the project reproducible. In other words, the process is not Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, or Reusable (or FAIR).\n\n\n\nThe project aims to simplify this situation in the price statistics discipline by tackling the challenges that researchers face. In other words, the project aims to lower the barrier for reproducibility, making it intuitively easy (with some practice) for researchers to work openly. From an open science point of view, making research more routinely reproducible will help accelerate the pace at which consensus is reached on various topics as results can quickly become replicable and even generalizable.\n\n\n\nAs the project tackles the main challenges facing the discipline, it aims to deliver the following aspects:\n\nObjective A: Developing an interim data catalogue tool for several open datasets and publishing several open datasets as a proof of concept. The idea is to start helping researchers know how to reference open datasets for better replicability within the discipline\n\nA.1.

    "text": "Research in the price statistics discipline is not as reproducible as we feel it should be. Most researchers utilize proprietary datasets (for instance internal datasets owned by their NSOs as part of their official work, or purchased datasets that require considerable financial investment for others to acquire). Research is also done using software available to researchers in a way that is custom to them and the code and detailed processes are typically not made easily available as part of the research project. This consequence is far from the intention of researchers, but is a result of the challenges to do this within the discipline. Specifically, it is not easy to find or access open datasets that can be used for research purposes. Once data is found, the metadata on each dataset will differ, making it challenging to process and use the data, such as for repeatable research processes. Finally, once a researcher has access to the data, it is not clear how code and processing logic should be shared as part of the research project to make the project reproducible. In other words, the process is not Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, or Reusable (or FAIR)."

In other words, the project aims to lower the barrier for reproducibility, making it intuitively easy (with some practice) for researchers to work openly. From an open science point of view, making research more routinely reproducible will help accelerate the pace at which consensus is reached on various topics as results can quickly become replicable and even generalizable."

    "text": "Citing an open dataset for a research project is straightforward if it is archived in an open research repository like Zenodo. In this case it will have the relevant metadata, along with a DOI, to make it easily citeable, even if access to these data is restricted. Unfortunately open datasets do not always reside in a repository like Zenodo. A common place for open datasets in statistics, and in particular price statistics, is as part of an R package on CRAN. Citing these datasets is not difficult—all CRAN packages have a DOI and are easily cited—but, as part of a package, data are more difficult to access."

    "text": "Example: {PriceIndices}\nThe {PriceIndices} R package comes with several datasets that can be useful for comparing different index-number methods. Citing these data is easy because R packages are highly citeable.\n@Manual{,\n  title = {PriceIndices: Calculating Bilateral and Multilateral Price Indexes},\n  author = {Jacek Białek},\n  year = {2025},\n  doi = {10.32614/CRAN.package.PriceIndices},\n  url = {https://cran.r-project.org/package=PriceIndices},\n  note = {R package version 0.2.3}\n}\nUsing these data is easy enough with R. Simply install the package and the datasets become available from within R.\n\n# install.packages(\"PriceIndices\")\nhead(PriceIndices::coffee)\n\n        time prices quantities prodID retID    description\n1 2017-12-01 123.55         13  32308  2183 instant coffee\n2 2017-12-01  56.08         16  51858  2183 instant coffee\n3 2017-12-01  66.90         11  51859  2183 instant coffee\n4 2017-12-01  66.90         10  51860  2183 instant coffee\n5 2017-12-01  34.30         11  51863  2183 instant coffee\n6 2017-12-01 141.20         10  55880  2183 instant coffee\n\n\nUsing these datasets is less convenient with, say, Python. One option is to simply export them in an interoperable format like Apache Parquet from R.\n\narrow::write_parquet(PriceIndices::coffee, \"coffee.parquet\")\n\nNow it is simple to use these data with Python.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\npd.read_parquet(\"coffee.parquet\").head()\n\n         time  prices  quantities  prodID  retID     description\n0  2017-12-01  123.55          13   32308   2183  instant coffee\n1  2017-12-01   56.08          16   51858   2183  instant coffee\n2  2017-12-01   66.90          11   51859   2183  instant coffee\n3  2017-12-01   66.90          10   51860   2183  instant coffee\n4  2017-12-01   34.30          11   51863   2183  instant coffee\n\n\nAnother approach, and one that doesn’t use R, is to simply download the {PriceIndices} package from CRAN and use the {rdata} Python package to read the datasets in Python.\n\ncurl -s https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/PriceIndices_0.2.3.tar.gz -o PriceIndices_0.2.3.tar.gz\ntar -vxzf PriceIndices_0.2.3.tar.gz PriceIndices/data\n\nPriceIndices/data/\nPriceIndices/data/dataU.rda\nPriceIndices/data/milk.rda\nPriceIndices/data/coffee.rda\nPriceIndices/data/data_DOWN_UP_SIZED.rda\nPriceIndices/data/dataAGGR.rda\nPriceIndices/data/sugar.rda\nPriceIndices/data/dataMATCH.rda\nPriceIndices/data/dataCOICOP.rda\n\n\n\nimport rdata\nimport pandas as pd\n\n\ndef date_constructor(obj, attr):\n    return pd.to_datetime(obj, unit=\"D\")\n\nconstructor_dict = {**rdata.conversion.DEFAULT_CLASS_MAP,\n                    \"Date\": date_constructor}\n\ncoffee = rdata.read_rda(\"PriceIndices/data/coffee.rda\",\n                        constructor_dict=constructor_dict)\n\npd.DataFrame(coffee[\"coffee\"]).head()\n\n        time  prices  quantities  prodID  retID     description\n1 2017-12-01  123.55          13   32308   2183  instant coffee\n2 2017-12-01   56.08          16   51858   2183  instant coffee\n3 2017-12-01   66.90          11   51859   2183  instant coffee\n4 2017-12-01   66.90          10   51860   2183  instant coffee\n5 2017-12-01   34.30          11   51863   2183  instant coffee"
